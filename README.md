# My Fitness Calculator

>## Outline
>***My Fitness Calculator*** is a programme that allows a user to keep track of his calorie consumption on a daily basis. It allows the user to add food to any of the meals during the day, as well as remove food from any of the meals. Add the calories that have been allotted to the specific food. Calculate total calories consumed at the end of the day by editing the calories allotted to each item.
People who desire to keep track of their health on a daily basis might employ this initiative. This idea appeals to me since it will assist many individuals in keeping track of what they consume in a thoughtful manner. This is a more *practical* and *helpful* project.
